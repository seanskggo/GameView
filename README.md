Hey team! This is the work branch where you create 'commits' (which is like a save-points) of your work. 
Try to commit regularly so that progress is saved. If you think your code is ready to be 'pushed' to the master branch,
create a 'pull request' (which means 'request to add to master branch') so that the code can be reviewed before being added.
